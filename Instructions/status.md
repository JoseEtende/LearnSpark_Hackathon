## 2. Project Summary

**Goal:** Transform passive video consumption into an active, interactive learning environment to unlock knowledge and enhance mastery.

**Description:** LearnSpark enables users to upload/link videos and interact with the content via AI-powered chat and quizzes, integrated within a user-friendly dashboard. The technical foundation relies heavily on Bolt.dev services.

**Timeline:** [Current project phase and key upcoming milestone dates/target completion - e.g., Currently in Development Phase (Sprint X of Y); Targeting Alpha release by [Date], Beta release by [Date], Production launch by [Date].]

**Overall Status:** [Choose one: Green (On Track), Yellow (Minor Delays/Issues), Red (Significant Issues/Off Track)]
*   [Brief justification for overall status]

## 3. Implementation Progress

*   **Smart Ingestion Pipeline:** (Processes videos: transcription, chunking, vector embedding)
    *   **Status:** [e.g., In Progress (75% Complete), Completed, Blocked]
    *   **Details:** [Brief description of progress this period, completed tasks, outstanding tasks, dependencies. e.g., Transcription module integration with Bolt Whisper service complete; Chunking logic implementation in progress; Need to finalize vector embedding integration with Bolt Vector Store.]
    *   **Owner(s):** [Name(s)]

*   **Interactive Chat:** (AI chat based *only* on video text, with source links)
    *   **Status:** [e.g., In Progress (60% Complete), Not Started]
    *   **Details:** [Progress on UI/UX, AI query logic, integration with vector store retrieval, source link generation. e.g., Basic chat UI functional; Initial tests connecting AI query to vector store data successful; Timestamp linking logic requires further development.]
    *   **Owner(s):** [Name(s)]

*   **Automated Quizzes:** (Generates multiple-choice quizzes from content, links to source)
    *   **Status:** [e.g., In Progress (30% Complete), Not Started]
    *   **Details:** [Progress on quiz generation algorithm, answer linking, UI. e.g., Research into quiz generation approaches complete; Basic quiz structure defined; Implementation starting next period.]
    *   **Owner(s):** [Name(s)]

*   **Dashboard:** (Integrates video player, transcript, chat, quiz)
    *   **Status:** [e.g., In Progress (40% Complete), Completed]
    *   **Details:** [Progress on core layout, integration points for other features, video player implementation. e.g., Core layout implemented; Video player embedded; Hooks for Chat and Transcript views in place.]
    *   **Owner(s):** [Name(s)]

## 4. Testing Status

*   **Unit Testing:** [Status - e.g., Ongoing; X% coverage; Specific modules tested]
*   **Integration Testing:** [Status - e.g., Starting this period; Key integrations tested (e.g., Bolt Storage upload, Bolt Transcription API call)]
*   **Feature Testing:** [Status - e.g., Ingestion Pipeline (Partial testing complete), Chat (Basic UI testing), Quizzes (Not yet tested), Dashboard (Layout testing)]
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** [Status - e.g., Not yet started; Planning Phase; Key UAT criteria defined]
*   **Overall Testing Health:** [Choose one: Good, Fair, Poor]
    *   [Brief explanation or key issues identified during testing]

## 5. Risks and Issues

*   **Issue/Risk:** [Brief description of the problem or potential problem]
    *   **Status:** [e.g., Open, Monitoring, Mitigated, Closed]
    *   **Impact:** [High, Medium, Low]
    *   **Mitigation/Action:** [What is being done or planned to address it]
    *   *Example 1: Risk* - Performance bottleneck with large video file ingestion pipeline.
        *   *Status:* Monitoring
        *   *Impact:* High
        *   *Mitigation/Action:* Implement chunked processing for large files; Conduct performance testing with varied file sizes early in development.
    *   *Example 2: Issue* - Difficulty accurately extracting timestamp for specific AI answer sources.
        *   *Status:* Open
        *   *Impact:* Medium
        *   *Mitigation/Action:* Investigate alternative timestamp extraction methods; Refine ingestion chunking strategy; Workaround involves linking to nearest chunk timestamp.
