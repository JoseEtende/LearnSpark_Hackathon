# LearnSpark Technology Stack Recommendation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 6, 2025

## 1. Technology Summary

The LearnSpark architecture is designed as a modern, interactive web application heavily leveraging the Bolt.dev platform for core infrastructure and AI-related services. The architecture follows a pattern where a performant Single Page Application (SPA) frontend interacts with a serverless backend, primarily using RESTful APIs hosted on Bolt.dev. The backend orchestrates the video ingestion pipeline utilizing Bolt.dev's background job processing, storage, transcription, and vector store capabilities. AI interactions for chat and quiz generation are also handled by the backend interfacing with Bolt.dev's AI services.

Key characteristics:
*   **Frontend:** Component-based SPA for rich user experience.
*   **Backend:** Serverless functions and background workers on Bolt.dev.
*   **Data:** Leverages Bolt.dev's integrated database and vector store.
*   **AI:** Relies heavily on Bolt.dev for transcription (Whisper), vector embedding, and AI interaction layers (LLMs).
*   **Infrastructure:** Almost entirely managed by Bolt.dev.

## 2. Frontend Recommendations

*   **Framework:** **React**
    *   *Justification:* A widely adopted, mature, and flexible library ideal for building complex, interactive user interfaces like a dashboard with integrated video players, chat windows, and dynamic transcripts. Its component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability.
*   **State Management:** **Zustand (for UI state) + React Query (for server state)**
    *   *Justification:* Zustand provides a minimalist and performant approach for managing local UI state (e.g., chat panel open/closed, current video timestamp). React Query is excellent for managing asynchronous server data fetching, caching, and mutations (e.g., fetching video data, sending chat messages, submitting quiz answers), significantly simplifying data synchronization and improving perceived performance.
*   **UI Library:** **Chakra UI or Tailwind CSS + Headless UI components**
    *   *Justification:* Accelerates development by providing pre-built, accessible UI components (Chakra UI) or powerful utility classes for rapid styling (Tailwind). Both offer flexibility to create a custom look and feel while ensuring consistency.

## 3. Backend Recommendations

*   **Language & Framework:** **Node.js with Lightweight Handlers or Micro-framework (e.g., Express)**
    *   *Justification:* Node.js is performant for I/O-bound tasks common in web APIs and serverless environments. Its large ecosystem is beneficial. Using lightweight handlers or a micro-framework like Express aligns well with the serverless function paradigm provided by Bolt.dev, keeping functions focused and efficient. TypeScript is recommended for type safety and improved code maintainability.
*   **API Design:** **RESTful APIs**
    *   *Justification:* A well-established and widely understood standard for building web services. REST provides clear conventions for defining endpoints, requests, and responses, making integration with the frontend straightforward. Bolt.dev's serverless endpoints are well-suited for hosting RESTful services.

## 4. Database Selection

*   **Database Type:** **Bolt.dev's Integrated Database (likely Relational)**
    *   *Justification:* The project explicitly leverages Bolt.dev's database service. Assuming this is a relational database (like PostgreSQL or similar), it is well-suited for storing structured data such as user profiles, video metadata, processed transcript chunks, quiz questions and answers, and potentially chat history.
*   **Schema Approach:** **Relational Schema**
    *   *Justification:* A normalized relational schema is appropriate for managing the relationships between users, videos, transcript chunks (potentially linked to timestamps and vectors), and quiz data. This provides data integrity and flexibility for querying related information.

## 5. DevOps Considerations

*   **Deployment:** Leverage **Bolt.dev's built-in CI/CD and deployment pipelines.**
    *   *Justification:* Bolt.dev manages the underlying infrastructure for serverless functions, background jobs, and databases. Utilizing their integrated deployment tools will be the most efficient path to deploying and updating the application components.
*   **Infrastructure Management:** **Managed primarily by Bolt.dev.**
    *   *Justification:* The core infrastructure (compute, storage, database, AI services) is provided and managed by Bolt.dev. Focus shifts to configuring services within the Bolt.dev platform, monitoring performance, and managing costs.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Utilize **Bolt.dev's integrated monitoring and logging tools** where available. Supplement with dedicated services if advanced observability is required, though Bolt.dev is expected to cover basics.

## 6. External Services

*   **Core Services (Storage, DB, Jobs, Auth, Transcription, Vector Store):** **Bolt.dev**
    *   *Justification:* As per project requirements, these fundamental services are provided by and tightly integrated with the Bolt.dev platform.
*   **AI Models (for Chat & Quiz Generation):** **Bolt.dev's integrated AI services OR LLM Providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) integrated via Bolt.dev.**
    *   *Justification:* The project relies on AI for interaction. Bolt.dev provides the vector store and transcription, and facilitates the AI interaction layer. Depending on Bolt.dev's specific offering, this might involve using models directly provided by Bolt.dev or requiring integration with external LLM providers using API keys managed through the Bolt.dev platform. Assume Bolt.dev handles the complexity of interacting with these models based on user prompts and retrieved context from the vector store.
*   **Video Player Library (Frontend):** **React Player or Video.js**
    *   *Justification:* While Bolt.dev handles storage, a robust frontend library is needed to embed and control video playback, handle timestamps, and synchronize the video with the dynamic transcript.

By heavily leveraging the Bolt.dev platform, LearnSpark can focus development effort on the unique active learning features rather than managing complex infrastructure and AI backend components.
